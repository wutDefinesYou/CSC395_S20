### Lab 9 and Lab 10
#### PD Motor Control
Lab 9 : Due: Thursday, April 2 before class
Lab 10 : Due Thursday, April 9 end of day

In this lab, you set up a Motor Positional Control System using PD Control. The nonpreemptive scheduler will manage all the tasks of motor control, potentiometer readings, trajectory management, and UI. The primary event-driven task is the encoder reading that is managed by the ISR.

Lab 9 Deliverables
- Framework established. Scheduler is set up to manage PD control, potentiometers, trajectory, and UI (but only the PD control and printing needs to be functional).
- PD Control functional. The system can achieve a reference position.
- Ability to print values of gains, velocity, reference and measured position (you need this to debug!!).

Lab 10 Deliverables
- Potentiometers controlling gains.
- Trajectory interpolation functional.
- Logging functional.

If you are using serial communication with the dongle, then you will also be using the Rx and Tx pins, D2 and D3, a.k.a. astar pins 0 and 1.

You may choose to connect these in a different way, but please make it very obvious in your header files how to connect everything.

#### Context for the Problem

Consider a geared system in which gear rotation leads to linear motion (maybe it's in a factory). Here you see a LEGO mock-up of a rack-and-pinion system.

</p>

If we attached a motor to the circular gear (replacing the hand crank), rotation of the motor would translate to rotational motion of the gear (pinion), which would translate to the movement of the linear gear (the rack). Now imagine putting a mechanical hand at the end of the rack to pick up parts at various places along its trajectory. If everything is calibrated, we can determine the position of the rack (and the mechanical hand) given the position of the circular gear (i.e. its angle from some point 0), which we can determine from the relative rotation of the motor. We might use this system to move objects around (better yet, it might be part of a larger system that rotates the entire mechanism thus the hand would be operable within a full circle).


#### System Setup

Keeping the above system in mind, for this lab you will implement a motor controller using PD control as part of a larger system of several periodic tasks. The system should be able to maintain positional control of the motor given a trajectory (i.e. a series of reference/goal positions). Other tasks you will need to schedule are the reading of a potentiometer for speeding up the motor (which is essentially increasing gains in the PD equation), recording data, and managing UI through serial communication.

For positional control, the motor should reach any referenced motor position without significant oscillation. You can modify the rise time (i.e. the time it takes to reach the reference position) by turning the potentiometer "up" or "down." Your goal is to find appropriate values for the gains Kd and Kp in the PD equation. In addition, you will develop an "interpolator" that can follow a positional trajectory (i.e. can reach a series of goal positions).

Your system will be composed of
- A PD controller (that relies on the accurate reading of the encoder). Design this so that the user can easily modify the period of this task. It is a separate task from the ISR for the encoder.
- Gains control of the motor using potentiometers.
- A user interface using USB/serial communication.
- Data recording for analysis.

#### PD Controller

The PD controller maintains the position of the motor using the measured and reference positions. It processes the encoder values to generate a drive signal to the motor. The encoder provides a measure of position and with this a measure of speed. The sampling rate of the encoder readings is not in your control, because it is interrupt-driven. The frequency of the PD controller should be carefully considered to keep the system stable and accurate.

In general, the PD controller (as a discrete equation) can be defined as:

```
Error = Reference - Measured
P = Error
D = Change in error over change in time (dt)
Pr = Position reference (goal input from the user)
Pm = Position measured (from the encoder reading in the ISR)
```

```
T = torque (or motor drive). This should be in range of -TOP to TOP
T = kP(P) + kD( delta(P) / dt )
T = kP(Pr-Pm) + kD(delta(Pr-Pm) / dt )
kP = Proportional gain (user defined value)
kD = Derivative gain (user defined value)
```

Note that when controlling position, the derivative term at time _i_ becomes:
```
delta( Pr - Pm ) / dt = ( Pr - Pm(i) ) - ( Pr - Pm(i-1) ) / dt
= ( Pr - Pr - Pm(i) + Pm(i-1) ) / dt
= - Velocity
T = kP(Pr-Pm) - kd(Velocity)
```

T is a signal that can be used directly to control the motor, except check that it is in range { -TOP, TOP }, and use absolute(T) and set motor direction appropriately. You should always be generating motor commands, regardless of whether the reference position is changing or not. This means that at any time, if you move the wheel/shaft by hand when controlling position, the PD controller should bring it back to the current reference position. In other words, even if the motor is where it should be, do not stop sending commands to the motor, instead send it 0 (or whatever torque value your controller produces).

The measured position and velocity (Pm and Vm) can be computed using the encoder. The encoder generates a pair of signals as the motor shaft rotates, which are used as input signals into 2 general I/O port pins. Use the code example for the PCINT ISR for these port pins and count the number of signal changes to track the position of the motor. The velocity can be determined by tracking the time between changes in position. Be careful that you track this correctly. **If the motor is moving, the velocity should not be zero even if there was no change since the last time you measured the position (this is because encoder counts are discrete not continuous)**.

Position reference (Pr) is provided through the user interface.
Kp and Kd (i.e. gains) are the terms that you define that determine how your system behaves. You will need to determine these values experimentally -- there will be a reasonable range of gain values within which you can use the potentiometer to increase or decrease to modify the rise time.

**Things to Watch For**:
- Are your types correct? Do not declare something as a uint if it needs a sign!
- Are your types correct? Is there an implicit cast that is causing something to go to 0?
- Are you maintaining the sign in your torque equation THEN converting to an absolute value and setting the direction appropriately based on the sign?
- Is the frequency of your PD controller so fast that you don't see positional change from release to release? If so, keep track of how much time has passed since the last value change to get an accurate measure of velocity.

#### Motor

The motor is attached to the Motor2 port (green header, middle). This corresponds to OC1B for the PWM drive signal and PE2 as the directional signal. You use the torque value generated from the controller to adjust the duty cycle of the waveform, thus the speed of the motor.

The encoder channels should be connected to Port B4 and B5, which correspond to PCINT4 and PCINT5 (a.k.a. AStar pins 8 and 9). Power through Port D1 (AStar pin 2).

#### Potentiometers

Connect the potentiometers to Port D6 and Port D7. These correspond to ADC9 and ADC10 (a.k.a. AStar pins 6 and 12).

#### User Interface

The user interface should supply the following functionality at a minimum (feel free to add in whatever makes your life easier for programming and debugging):

Using key presses:
- R/r : Set the reference position in **degrees**. Value is RELATIVE to current position.
- Z/z: Zero the encoder marking the current position as 0 degrees.
- V/v: View the current values Kd, Kp, Vm, Pr, Pm, and T
- S/s: Send saved data

You might find it useful to have functionality to calibrate your potentiometers. For example, you might indicate that the current potentiometer position is zero such that any readings greater should increase the gain and readings less than the current value should decrease the gain. Or you can set the step size, such that a change of x in the potentiometer reading corresponds to a "step size" change in the gain, for example every time the potentiometer changes by 5 units, the kD will increase by 0.10.

You will need to figure out how to log your data. This might involve storing it in a buffer, then periodically dumping it to the terminal, or perhaps you are constantly printing to the terminal. You probably want a menu option to start and stop logging. "screen" on linux and mac will only show a screen full of data at a time, thus you will want to dump your data into a file. There is a logging option for screen -- more on this later, I have to track down the commands to do this.

#### Code Deliverable

1. Hand in all of the code necessary to compile your project. Please put sufficient comments in your code so that we can follow what you are doing. Also, if your code is not working in some aspect, please include that in your report. Your code should include the following:
  - PD Controller
  - UI to specify a relative reference position
  - Gains Control using potentiometers
  - Data logging functionality


#### Looking Ahead

The second written assignment will be tied to this lab. You will be asked to run a couple of experiments related to tuning gains and the scheduler.

One line of inquiry will be related to experimenting with the gains to establish a "reasonable" range. Do not set the torque to 0 at the moment you cross the reference position. Make sure you have settled into that position. You will probably have a threshold that, when T is below it, you set T to 0. Report your range of gain values for kP and kD.

  It might be useful to do the following to tune your gains.
  - Use only P. Start with a very low gain so that the motor runs very slowly and takes its time getting to the set position.
  - Increase the gain to get a fast response (i.e. get to your set point quickly). Then increase it a little more to oscillate.
  - Add in D to dampen the response and eliminate oscillation.

Another line of inquiry will be related to controlling the timing of your system. Think about the timing of the PD controller and how that might influence the stability of the motor control.
